# TP2-ALSDD-2025
Second TP of the module ALSDD on binary search trees.

- This file contains insights, recommandations, and instructions concerning my TP2 program.
  
  1. The majority of the practical work was done on the Khawarizm II+ AFE (2023) - Â© Pr D.E ZEGOUR 2023 - IDE using the Z language. The rest of the work was completed on Visual Studio Code using the C language. You can also use CodeBlocks and there won't be any compiling errors, even if there are, I uploaded in this folder the compiled "**TP2.exe**" that you can execute.
  2. To make changes or execute the "**TP2.alg**" file, which contains the Khawarizm part of the practical work, you will need the IDE I mentioned earlier that can be found here: https://zegour.esi.dz/
  3. The report on the practical work was done using the LaTeX language, you can find it in the folder. The graphs and tables used in it were created using a Python script that you can find in the folder as well. It is based on "**.csv**" files generated by the C program, I removed the lines that generate the files but you can easily rewrite them.
